                        device supports such capabilities. We also compare our
                        customer list to additional/other lists received from
                        other allied companies in an effort to avoid sending

                disclosure of Personal information (including sensitive personal

                Information. However, it is important for you to protect
                yourself against unauthorised access to your password and to

                and protect it from misuse, interference, loss and unauthorized

                possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our
